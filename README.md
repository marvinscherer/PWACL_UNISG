Description:
This is the official code for a project in the course "Programming with Advanced Computer Languages" at the University of St. Gallen. The aim is to build a trading bot which takes your binance account and rebalances it for a given frequency, all automatically. 

1) In order to install the required packages, run in your terminal run: 
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2) Put your own "API PUBLIC" and "API SECRET" from your Binance Account in config.py
